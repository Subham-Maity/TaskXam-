## Endpoints

The base URL for the API is `http://localhost:5000`. The following endpoints are available:

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                                      |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | /tasks        | Returns a list of all tasks                      |

| DELETE | /tasks/:id    | Deletes the task with the id                     |

## Data Format

The data format for tasks is JSON. A task object has the following properties:

- id (string) - a unique identifier for the task
- description (string) - a detailed description of the task
- status (string) - the current status of the task, either "completed" or "incomplete"
- priority (string) - the priority level of the task, either "low", "medium", "high" or "urgent"
- dueDate (date) - the deadline for completing the task
- owner (object id) - the user who created the task

An example of a task object is:

```json
{
  "id": "f3b8d9c4-dfb3-4f1a-bb5d-f9b19fbd7d40",
  "description": "Write an essay on RESTful APIs for school",
  "status": "incomplete",
  "priority": "high",
  "dueDate": "2023-03-31T00:00:00Z",
  "owner": "60a7c86e8e2e4a0015d6f6a1"
}
```
